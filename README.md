# DiluviumDEM

DiluviumDEM is a global coastal digital elevation model based on the CopernicusDEM (30m) but corrected up to 80 meters in elevation using a LightGBM model. The code to generate DiluviumDEM is published in this repository. DiluviumDEM can be downloaded at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8329293 or as an Earth Engine asset here: https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=users/ddusseau/DiluviumDEM

The methodology used to create DiluviumDEM is described in the article *DiluviumDEM: Enhanced accuracy in global coastal digital elevation models*Â published in the journal Remote Sensing of Environment.
